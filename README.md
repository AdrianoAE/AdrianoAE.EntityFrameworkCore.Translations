# Experimental Project

The purpose of this project is to improve the way we deal with domain translations. Most of the times we need our product to have localization, but it's not a responsibility of our Domain to know about it, since it's a UI concern for the end user.

The project is in development and have a lot of problems that need to be solved, like how to allow SaveChanges and Queries for a specific language.
